I set up the directory roughly as suggested by require.js, underscore and lemonad.

If the directory structure is so egregious we need a reboot, then I can restart the repo, and you can reclone from GitHub. 

Conventions: 
	tabs, camel/pascal-case. 
	egyptian-braces only (sc insertion),
	semicolons would be appreciated

	unix-line endings please, I think that
	non-unix lines can total a program

	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10418975/how-to-change-line-ending-settings

depends on require.js (possibly a testing framework like 
jasmine too, at a later date).

Merging Changes;

	merge from your personal branch to dev, and then from dev to master for releases. 
	commits to dev should actually work, or be suspected to work. merge with dev frequently enough,
	to avoid horrible merge conflicts.

Enjoy!
